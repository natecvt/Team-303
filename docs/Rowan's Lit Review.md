3D Print farms have expanded exponentially in recent years, but all face a similar issue. There is an inherent bottleneck in print output due to downtime after a print is finished, during which an operator must manually remove the completed print and prepare the printer for the next job. Team 303 has been tasked with automating this process. The purpose of Team 303 is to design, manufacture, and implement an autonomous 3D printer farm with the ability to remove completed print beds, insert a new clean print bed, and start a new print without manual intervention. Developing such a system will require iterative design informed by existing research and technologies. While the need for automating 3D print farms is not new, prior solutions vary in their approaches and integration into the printer ecosystem. By gathering literature of potential solutions, the team can inform design decisions in the future. The key points of literature reviewed in this paper are alternative solutions and potential issues with reliability that can be faced depending on what solution is chosen.

The important aspect of 3D print farm automation is clearing finished printers so that they can continue printing more parts without delay. This can be achieved either by removing the part from the print bed or by replacing the occupied bed with a clean one. Each method presents challenges: part removal introduces greater mechanical complexity and opportunities for error, while bed-swapping systems require storage for clean and used beds and precise alignment to ensure print quality. Another factor that is apparent in previous solutions is whether the automated system is tailor built or a one-size-fits-all for various setups. Tailored systems are typically integrated directly into a controlled environment, while generalized solutions are freestanding and adaptable to different setups. This distinction is significant for Team 303, as it will strongly influence how the sponsor’s existing print farm is automated.

Prusa Research, one of the largest 3D printer manufacturers worldwide, announced its Automated Farm System (AFS) in 2020 [1]. Their solution was a scalable system of 34 CoreXY printers and was first demonstrated at Dubai’s EXPO 2020. This system is tailor built, runs on “internally developed farm management software”, and can automatically collect completed build plates. It is built using cube-shaped frames that each house its own printer with “hot-swapping capabilities”. These are the main points of the Prusa design, since printers can easily be removed for maintenance and new frames can be added to scale production. The system is managed by proprietary farm software, Prusa Connect, which identifies completed jobs, dispatches a robotic toolhead to remove build plates to storage, replaces them with clean beds, and automatically initiates the next print. Key strengths of this design are scalability and ease of maintenance, as printers can be individually removed for service and additional frames can be added to expand capacity. However, the cost is high, at about $3000+ per printer. The custom cube-shaped frames enable precise spatial mapping of each unit, assisted by QR code scanning on the build plates for alignment of the toolhead to remove and replace build plates accurately. One major aspect of the Prusa AFS is that the entire print farm is stored in a custom enclosure, with the storage shelves and robotic removal system also enclosed. While effective, this solution is impractical for the sponsor’s setup, which already employs 10 printers on commercially available racks, and a large custom box would be too intrusive on the existing space. Important aspects of this design that could be implemented, however, are modifying the existing racks with rigid mounts to lock each printer into a specified coordinate, then using more accurate sensors or computer vision to finetune precise alignment.

While the Prusa AFS demonstrates the benefits of a custom, top-down solution, it is less applicable to existing spaces. Rather a bottom-up approach that focuses on existing components of the sponsor’s print farm may be better. In [2], Swaleh Owals presents a flexible solution that could be applied to existing printer setups. The Hackaday Project outlines the student’s own development of a free-standing robot to automate 3D print farms. The project highlights the importance of customization that rapid prototyping offers, but that it is too slow to meet traditional production line requirements. A key decision made in the projects design is to avoid mounting the robotic arm for automation to a gantry system and instead mount it to a mobile base. This Automated Guided Vehicle (AGV) avoids gantry-based designs by operating on a mobile base, reducing its footprint and allowing it to navigate in three dimensions within a space. The project highlights the adaptability of such systems, which is valuable for Team 303 given the possibility of farm expansion or relocation. Another key aspect of the Hackaday design is to keep costs low and allow potential for adjustments after installation. The AGV uses computer vision to identify printer locations via QR codes and uses an electromagnetic effector to remove build plates. An Automated Guided Vehicle is one of the most flexible design solutions possible, since the entire system is self-contained and relatively minor modifications are necessary to allow the vehicle to identify 3D printers in an existing setup. The electromagnetic removal system required them to make more major modifications to the 3D printer beds that the sponsor would not allow. A more viable adaptation would involve replacing the electromagnetic effector with a physical gripper capable of reliably removing and replacing build plates. The Hackaday project also underscores the importance of safety, integrating multiple emergency stop switches in compliance with CSA Z432-16 standards. Although the AGV solution requires more complex software for computer vision and precise navigation, it offers versatility and scalability within constrained spaces, making it a promising option for the sponsor’s environment.

Both the Prusa and Hackaday approaches emphasize the importance of accuracy and repeatability in continuously automated systems with little manual operation and intervention. The article in [3] focuses on defining and specifying accuracy and repeatability in manufacturing. Consistent and accurate motion are important to ensure consistent product output without damage to the printers. The article defines accuracy as “how closely a robot can reach a programmed position” and repeatability as “a robot’s ability to consistently return to the same position when commanded to do so multiple times under the same conditions”. It focuses on positional accuracy in XYZ coordinates and pose accuracy in orientation in the correct spot. These metrics are critical for 3D print farm automation, where toolheads must precisely interface with build plates to avoid damaging printers or parts. Common accuracy testing methods include laser interferometers, vision-based tracking, and on-site performance checks, though minimizing manual intervention makes vision-based systems preferable. Prior solutions used QR code scanning to correct errors after positioning, demonstrating the value of real- time feedback. Factors such as “calibration drift”, “temperature variation”, and “tooling accuracy” can degrade accuracy over time. Progressional offsets due to vibrations of the systems could be prevalent in 3D print farms and will need to be a major focus as the automated robot will be running constantly throughout the day. There will be definite temperature variation due to the nature of 3D printers heating and cooling repeatably, and the weight of the designed toolhead will affect the ability of the robot to move accurately. To mitigate these effects, the system should employ a dedicated home sensor for global calibration, supplemented by local sensors to fine-tune alignment with each printer. Effective methods to improve robot accuracy and repeatability mentioned in the article include scheduled recalibration, mechanical and software refinements, and the use of AI for real-time compensation. Establishing clear accuracy and repeatability standards will guide the design and ensure the system consistently meets sponsor requirements.

The sources reviewed highlight different approaches on 3D print farm automation. The Prusa AFS demonstrates a highly scalable, tailor-built solution, while the Hackaday AGV project illustrates the adaptability of freestanding, retrofittable systems. Both approaches emphasize the necessity of accuracy and repeatability, as outlined in [3], to achieve reliable, long-term automation. Accuracy and repeatability are very important for an automated 3D print farm as it will be running near constantly to reduce downtime and ideally would have very little human interaction required for operation. For Team 303, the challenge lies in balancing scalability, adaptability, and precision while integrating into the sponsor’s existing infrastructure. These insights will guide the definition of system-level objectives and inform critical design trade-offs in the development of an effective automated print farm robot.
